# On-line Store using Node.js

I built this project to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript using NodeJs
This is an online model kits store.
- Users can filter their search by:
    - categories
    - name
    - price
    - number of pieces
    - building materials
- Must register and log in to be able to buy.
- The user with the admin role can promote or demote users with a lower role.       
- Both the price and the promotional price are displayed. They can add products to the shopping cart or view the product in detail.
- In the shopping cart,
you can change the quantity, see the total price or remove products from the cart.
The products can be bought within the limit of the available stock.
